## Main Concept

This is an application which uses Giphy.com's API to generate GIF images based on pre-determined or user-created keywords. Users can either press one of the reaction buttons at the top of the page, or create their own by typing in a new word and pressing "Submit". The application then fetches the 10 currently most popular GIF images related to that keyword. Users are also able to see the rating of the image, its title, and a 2-click download link for the images of their choice.
